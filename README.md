# Battle Turn

Battle Turn is a two-player turn based game. Each player controls 3 characters, a _warrior_ (a lot of life and little reach), an _archer_ (middle life and long range), and a _magician/healer_ (little life and little range but she can heal). Its development took 5 days, and was the first project of the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack.

The technologies used to develop it were: **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript** and the library **JQuery**.
